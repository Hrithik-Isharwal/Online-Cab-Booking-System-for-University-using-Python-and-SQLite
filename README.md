This project is considered in order to provide cab/ taxi facilities to the students and faculty members of the university. The current system is manual and it is time consuming. It is also cost in-effective, and average return is low and diminishing. Currently, customers can call or walk-in in order to rent or reserve a vehicle. The staff of the company will check their file to see which vehicle is available for rental. The current system is error prone and customers are dissatisfied. The goal of this project is to automate vehicle rental and reservation so that customers do not need to walk-in or call in order to reserve a vehicle.

They can go online and reserve any kind of vehicle they want form the inventory of available vehicle. The user is provided with a user-friendly system by which user can book a cab just in few minutes. It also provides multiple payment system such as cash, card or online payment options.

The user details are stored for further reservations so that user doesnâ€™t need to fill mandatory details each and every time. The system will automatically fill the details of an existing user.

This system also stores all the booking details so it is easy for the admin to provide drivers with the details of booking with all the information like pickup point, drop-off location, etc. And it is easy to maintain the data using database.
